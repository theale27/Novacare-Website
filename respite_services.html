<strong>Novacare provides respite care to suit people in most situations.</strong>
<br>
Respite care benefits families and loved ones alike. Our highly trained staff are sensitive to the needs of carers and understand that it can be difficult to leave your loved ones. Staff assist families to decide on appropriate respite care and what actions can be taken to ensure the experience is positive for all involved.
<br><br>
<strong>Overnight, emergency and short-term respite</strong><br>
The Ailsa Craig Respite Cottage at Hamilton is available to carers who require short term or emergency overnight respite. Funded respite places are available to most carers.

Ailsa Craig Respite Cottage is open 24 hours / 7 days for 48 weeks of each year.
