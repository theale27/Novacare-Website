Our dementia-specific centre based day care program includes outings, day trips, entertainment and centre based activities that are thoroughly planned and adjusted to meet the changing needs of each care recipient. Groups are kept small; enabling one to one interaction in a calm atmosphere. Respite is available as a one-off or on a regular basis. The service is available from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday and is funded by the Australian Government and NSW Government Human Services - Ageing, Disability and Home Care.

<strong>Overnight, emergency and short term respite</strong><br>
The Ailsa Craig Respite House at Hamilton is available to carers who require short term or emergency overnight respite. The centre provides a modern, home-like environment and can accommodate up to six people for overnight stays. Carers can take a short break with the comfort of knowing that their loved one is being cared for by qualified care staff in a comfortable, secure setting. The service is available seven days and evenings per week.
<br><br>
<strong>Carer Information</strong><br>
Our experienced staff remain up to date with the latest information on dementia care. They are available for a confidential chat or support and advice. Carers can join a carers group and access a variety of informative resources at Ailsa Craig Respite Cottage.
