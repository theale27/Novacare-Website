<strong>Novacare Incorporated is known for our high quality delivery of community aged care and disability packages. We work hard to ensure that we attract committed, compassionate staff and we then support staff with ongoing training and development opportunities.</strong>
<br><br>
You can be assured you will receive quality services from qualified aged & disability care workers or nursing staff and that your services will be well planned and managed by a coordinator. Many of our clients look forward to visits from their regular care workers.
<br><br>
<strong>Services</strong><br>
A range of flexible support activities can be tailored into a package to suit your particular needs and to help you to remain living at home for as long as possible. Service times and days can be negotiated to fit with your lifestyle.
<br><br>
Services can include a combination of:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Bathing, showering, toileting, and personal hygiene</li>
    <li>Dressing or undressing</li>
	<li>Mobility and transfers</li>
	<li>Meal preparation & assistance with nutritional needs</li>
	<li>Shopping</li>
	<li>Transport to appointments</li>
	<li>Socialisation</li>
	<li>Medication supervision</li>
	<li>Domestic assistance including housekeeping and laundry</li>
	<li>Lawn, garden and external home maintenance</li>
	<li>Additional support during periods of specific need</li>
</ul>
<br>
<strong>Packages</strong><br>
We offer the following packaged care options funded with assistance from the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Community Aged Care Packages (CACP) – a package of community care designed for people with low-level care needs that still want to live in their own home. These services are aimed at preventing premature admission to residential care.</li>
    <li>Extended Aged Care at Home packages (EACH) – nursing home level of care for people who need more assistance than provided in a CACPs package and wish to remain living at home.</li>
    <li>Extended Aged Care at Home Dementia packages (EACHD) – high level care tailored to the individuals with challenging behaviours arising from their dementia</li>
</ul>
<br>
<strong>Am I eligible?</strong><br>
If you live in the Newcastle local government area and are aged 65 years or over or are entitled to disability services, you may be eligible for funded services. Many of our clients live alone and some live with a partner or relatives. Regardless of your living arrangements, you may be eligible for services.
<br><br>
You must first be assessed for eligibility for these packages by the Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) or National Disability Insurance Scheme. If you meet the criteria, the Aged Care Assessment Team will provide your details to Novacare and we will contact you when a vacancy becomes available. Phone the Community Access Point on 1300 731 556 to arrange an assessment.
<br><br>
<strong>What is the cost?</strong><br>
The fee for a government subsidised package of services is 17.5% of the client’s income, however demand for these places is high. For private services fees please contact Novacare to discuss on 1300 363 654.
