<strong>If you are enjoying living independently in the community but are finding it hard to lift heavy washing or shopping bags or do household chores, our domestic assistance service may be for you.</strong>
<br><br>
This flexible service provides help with day to day tasks including housework, laundry, shopping, appointments and errands. We can help you maintain your independence, enjoy living at home and prevent early admission to residential care.
<br><br>
<strong>Our services include:</strong><br>
<ul>
	<li>House Cleaning</li>
    <li>Laundry washing and ironing</li>
	<li>Help with shopping</li>
	<li>General household support, such as paying bills and accounts, helping with telephone calls, and help with other essential household tasks</li>
	<li>Transport</li>
</ul>
<br>
<strong>Am I eligible?</strong><br>
Currently we provide domestic assistance services to residents of Newcastle, West Lake Macquarie and Port Stephens. Many of our clients live alone and some live with a partner or relatives. Regardless of your living arrangements you may be eligible for services.
<br><br>
You must first be assessed for eligibility for the domestic assistance program by the Community Access Point. If you meet the criteria the Community Access Point will provide your details to us and we will contact you when a vacancy becomes available. Phone the Community Access Point on 1300 731 556 to arrange an assessment.
<br><br>
Alternatively, domestic assistance is available on a private fee basis. No referral is needed. Contact us for more information.
<br><br>
<strong>What is the cost?</strong><br>
The subsidised fee for domestic assistance is $12 per hour however you may be assessed for a fee reduction if you are experiencing financial hardship. No client will be refused a service due to a genuine inability to pay the scheduled fee.
<br><br>
This service is funded by the Australian Government and NSW Government Human Services - Ageing Disability and Home Care. There is high demand for this service.
<br><br>
Novacare also provides domestic assistance on a private fee basis. The private service fee for home support services is $52.60 per hour. Private fee services are a good option for people who are not eligible or those waiting for a Government subsidised place.
