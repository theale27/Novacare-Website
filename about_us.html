<br><br>
Novacare Community Services Limited is an aged care and disability service provider.  Novacare provides services to those in need of care and assistance in their home or may require day care or short-term respite care/accommodation. Social and physical wellbeing activities and services are provided. 
<br><br>
Novacare is an independent, not-for-profit, charity providing quality services to support people to live at home and enjoy life in their community.
<br><br>
Our clients share a common goal of wanting to remain living at home in their community for as long as possible. We provide numerous services to help people achieve this goal.
Our services may include helping with housework, assisting with shopping or, as needs increase, providing more complex personal care such as showering, toileting and dressing and nursing assistance.  Novacare offers a lawn, garden and exterior house maintenance service.  Social activities and outings are important for wellbeing and our Novacare Milpara Centre at Merewether provides a wide range of choices.
<br><br>
We provide extensive support to carers. This includes a number of respite options (day care and short-term accommodation) to give carers a well earned break. Our carers support group is a valuable network of people sharing similar experiences.
<br><br>
Since 1993 Novacare has enjoyed a position of trust and a solid reputation for caring for vulnerable people. Managed by a Board of Directors, we are an incorporated association with a focus on quality and transparent business operations.
<br><br>
Our caring staff are qualified and supported and we are renowned for the quality of our training programs. We maintain the highest standards of community care.
<br><br>
We can help you make the right choices for your future or that of a family member, friend or a loved one by discussing all the options available.
<br><br>
Novacare acknowledges the support of Funded Programs provided by:
<ul>
	<li>Home and Community Care</li>
	<li>NSW Government– Family and Community Services</li>
	<li>Australian Government – Dept. of Health and Ageing</li>
